# rackspace-cloud-orchestration-templates
Repo for different Rackspace Cloud Orchestration templates I've modified.

Current working template is:

* Dual IIS 2012R2 Servers.yaml - let's you build 2 Windows Server 2012R2 with IIS, .NET 4.5.1 framework, and an FTP user

** Known Issues **
* Noticed that on a build the Rackspace status screen is a little jumbled up and labels are not applied properly.
